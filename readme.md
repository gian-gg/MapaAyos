## 📌 Notes

- `src/` is strictly for application logic and should not be directly accessible via URL (use `.htaccess` to block access).
- `public/` is the only web-accessible directory; place all user-facing assets here (CSS, JS, images).
- Go to `database/` to initialize the tables and data needed.a
- Update `.htaccess` to accomodate new routes/pages.
